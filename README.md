# Metrical Inscriptions
Work on aligning metrical lines with grammatical structures for inscriptions with "irregular" metrical patterns

# Citation & Analysis

This is a project in editing and analysis of an inscription, demonstrating:

1. An abstract concept of "text", following the "OHCO<sup>2</sup>" model.[^ohco2]
1. Separation of concerns.
1. Analysis by text-deformation.
1. Canonical citation.

[^ohco2]:   Originally proposed by Smith and Weaver  (2009), "[Applying Domain Knowledge from Structured Citation Formats to Text and Data Mining: Examples Using the CITE Architecture](http://katahdin.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/TR2009-649.pdf)", *Dartmouth Computer Science Technical Report TR2009-649*.

## Traditional Presentation

CEG 509- IG II2 8883 http://epigraphy.packhum.org/text/11302

Ἑλλὰς μὲν πρωτεῖα τέχνης αὐλῶν ἀπένειμεν </br>
Θηβαίωι Πο<τ>άμωνι, τάφος δ’ ὅδε δέξατο σῶμα·</br>
πατρὸς δὲ μνήμαισιν Ὀλυνπίχου αὔξετ’ ἔπαινος</br>
οἷον ἐτέκνωσεμ παῖδα σοφοῖς βάσανον.</br>
Πατρόκλεια Ποτάμωνος γυνή.</br>

## In translation:

Greece gave the first prize for flute playing to the Theban Potamon and this tomb received his body; with this remembrance the glory of his father is aggrandized, he who gave rise to a child tested with the touchstone of skill. Patrocleia, Potamon's wife.

## Editions, Exemplars, Analyses, & Deformations

- Strictly Diplomatic
- Normalized, with editorial status
- Hexameter lines
     - Feet
     - Syllables
     - Metrical Values

> Note on URNs for Poetic analysis: `urn:cts:ctsDemo:tufts:cle395.dipl.poetry:3.1.1.1`. The first hexameter line starting on line 3 of the Diplomatic edition (3.1); the first metrical foot of that line (“incoli…’) would be (3.1.1), and the first syllable of that foot (“in…”) would be (3.1.1.1).  The next hexameter is the first line to begin on line 4 of the diplomatic edition, so it is `urn:cts:ctsDemo:tufts:cle395.dipl.poetry:4.1`.
